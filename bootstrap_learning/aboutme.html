                               <p>I am <mark>Karthik JEEVA</mark>,24 years old.I was born on 22<sup>nd</sup>June 1993.
                                    I was born in garden city of India,born to Rajeswari and Jeeva.My mother toungue is Tamil.
                                    I grew up in a village:Bangalore.I am always close to nature.Climbing trees,jogging in the woods :
                                    just roaming around enjoying nature is one of  pleasant moment in my life.I didn't have any aim in my life except one;
                                    to live peacefully.I didn't have any knowledge in politics or on my future career.After the world cup cricket,I loved to watch and play.
                                    I spent most of my day playing cricket.My parents never told me or imposed their dream on me neither I had a dream of my own.
                                    But I felt happy when people noticed me after doing something crazy.

                                  As a teenager I grew up watching cricket matches.I loved the people's attention towards the match.
                                  I started playing the game as a professional.This was also the reason that turned my life completely in another direction.
                                  I believed that everything I do is going to take me to top.Then came my board I had to devote my time 
                                  for the exams.Though I forget the professional cricket.I started adapting the game for my own fun.
                                  After clearing the board exams,I had no idea what to do next.As engineering seats were easily available,
                                  I took up engineering.In the begnning I had no clue what it was later on I took learning the subject as passion and started
                                  to devote my time.Then went on to masters in Science and technology from France.
